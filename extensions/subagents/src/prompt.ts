The subagent's final output is queued back to you as a message when it settles, or collect it explicitly with subagent_wait. Children cannot orchestrate more agents/workflows or see this conversation, so the prompt must be self-contained; pi children CAN clarify ambiguous requirements via ask_question, which arrives as a question on their result. Choose an allowlisted profile to let a child delegate constrained subtasks. For multi-step pipelines with phase dependencies, use the workflow tool instead of hand-chaining subagents. Only use trusted working directories. A configured concurrency cap applies across all harnesses.";
